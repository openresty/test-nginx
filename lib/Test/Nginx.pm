=head1 NAME

Test::Nginx - Data-driven test scaffold for Nginx C module and Nginx/OpenResty-based libraries and applications

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution provides two testing modules for Nginx C module development:

=over

=item *

L<Test::Nginx::Socket> (This is highly recommended.)

This library also has the following subclasses:

=over

=item *

L<Test::Nginx::Socket::Lua>

=item *

L<Test::Nginx::Socket::Lua::Stream>

=item *

L<Test::Nginx::Socket::Lua::Dgram>

=back

=item *

L<Test::Nginx::LWP> (This is obsolete.)

=back

All of them are based on L<Test::Base>.

Usually, L<Test::Nginx::Socket> is preferred because it works on a much lower
level and not that fault tolerant like L<Test::Nginx::LWP>.

Also, a lot of connection hang issues (like wrong C<< r->main->count >> value in nginx
0.8.x) can only be captured by L<Test::Nginx::Socket> because Perl's L<LWP::UserAgent> client
will close the connection itself which will conceal such issues from
the testers.

Test::Nginx automatically starts an nginx instance (from the C<PATH> env)
rooted at t/servroot/ and the default config template makes this nginx
instance listen on the port C<1984> by default. One can specify a different
port number by setting his port number to the C<TEST_NGINX_PORT> environment,
as in

    export TEST_NGINX_PORT=1989

=head1 INSTALLATION

If you have `cpan` installed, you can simply run the command to install this module:

    sudo cpan Test::Nginx

If you want to install from the source code directory directly, you can run

    sudo cpan .

If you prefer F<cpanm> to F<cpan> (like I do!), you can replace C<cpan> in the commands above with C<cpanm>.

Otherwise you can install this module in the good old way below:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    sudo make install

=head1 SOURCE REPOSITORY

This module has a Git repository on Github, which has access for all.
